# Scripts_for_Co-occurrence_analysis
Analysis Scripts for Co-occurrence of rare variants implicates gene pairs in cytoskeletal pathways and is associated with increased severity for ASD

This repository contains analysis scripts for identifying and characterizing co-occurring rare variants in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using the RareComb methodology across Korean and European ancestry cohorts.

## Overview

The analysis pipeline consists of variant quality control, de novo variant (DNV) calling, rare variant filtering, RareComb-based gene pair identification, statistical validation, and downstream functional characterization.
